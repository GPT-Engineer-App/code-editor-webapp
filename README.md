# code-editor-webapp

Create a web app similar to the programming editor visual studio code. UI design should match a modern, clean editor. Allow dark mode. Make dark mode default. 

Header row: Add file, edit, selection, view, go, run as menu items on the left side. Add a search bar on the right side (all in one row). 

Main content: 
We have a three column layout. 
First column: Should be very narrow, vertical aligned icons: explorer, search, source control, debugging and extensions. 
Second column: explorer. 
Third column: Editor with open file.  The file in the editor can be closed. Add syntax highlighting.

Add mock data for a simple web app. Show index file in editor.
